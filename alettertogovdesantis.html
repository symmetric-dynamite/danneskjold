                Dear Governor Desantis, <br><br>

                In Jacobson vs Massachusetts, the Supreme Court used the words "great danger to society" 
                to describe a disease that had a 30% fatality rate (small pox). The entirety of the ruling was 
                predicated upon the transfer of risk from the unvaccinated to the vaccinated 
                for a disease that claimed 3 out of 10. <br><br>
                
                One must wonder whether the Supreme Court would rule in favor of the state when the fatality rate 
                is 1.5%. How about .005%? At what point does a bacterial or viral infection cease being a "great danger to society"? <br><br> 
                If the Supreme Court permits the state - and private enterprise - to mandate and coerce through fines or otherwise, 
                for a disease with a fatality rate as low as 1.5%, then this would most certainly open a pandora's box wherein the state could mandate lockdown after lockdown, for almost any disease, or anything with any degree of risk, with the stroke of an apparatchiks pen. 
                
                <br><br>
                Furthermore, a digital passport could be used to consolidate individual data onto one platform. 
                For example, the application could access search history, location data, monitor social behavior, 
                turn on the microphone and camera, access photos, or be used for other nefarious attacks on privacy and liberty.
                One could see a future in which all payments are conducted through a digital passport, using a federal reserve 
                backed blockchain that would record every transaction, analyze spending habits, take note of donations, etc. 
                In this bleak world, it would not be hard to imagine politburo's weaponizing the application to freeze the accounts of political dissidents or non compliant citizens.  

                <br><br>
                
                I kindly request that the governor and attorney general move swiftly, with a broad coalition of states, to seek an immediate injunction upon current mandates, 
                and attempt to strike down any form of vaccinated passports as unconstitutional. 

               
                <br><br>
                
                Sincerely, <br><br>
                Liam Danneskjold <br>
                9th of July, 2021
