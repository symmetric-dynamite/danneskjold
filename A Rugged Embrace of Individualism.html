                Collectivism presupposes that individuality, the process of individuation itself, the core 
                beliefs and desires of individuals in general, and the very nature of happiness — or the pursuit 
                thereof — is somehow rooted in homogeneous precepts dictated by oligarchs, patricians, technocrats,
                tyrants, philosopher kings, or within some utilitarian framework inclined to focus on the 
                end itself — using any means to crush opposition, speech, and self expression, in favor of a 
                poorly defined and wholly subjective grand utopia. Promulgators of such systems invariably criticize 
                the exigencies of private property while refusing to disseminate the inefficacy of their chosen 
                mode of production. Even a basic reading of history shows clearly, and without any equivocation, 
                that these ideas are non starters, that such policies are a disease to human expression, a 
                regression of philosophical liberalism, a return to factions, anarchy, and to a dark age of 
                orthodoxy. <br><br>
                
                Today, America has forgotten its core precepts: namely, that its glorious destiny has always been 
                forged in that rugged embrace of individualism.
                <br><br>
                
                America’s republic was borne out of puritan philosophical liberalism; one that stood firmly, 
                perhaps even naively, but certainly romantically, on the shoulders of Grotius and Cicero, 
                Locke and Kant, Luther and Publius, and was summarized succinctly, sentimentally, in the most 
                eloquent of ways by St. Augustine and Martin Luther King: that is, that any law conflicting with 
                natural law is “perverse” or "Lex iniusta non est lex", which means “an unjust law is no law at all”. 
                These are not platitudes or trivial expressions; rather, they embody the very substructure of a 
                virtuous republic. Such precepts reject determinism and nominalism, the shackles of totalitarianism,
                and have emerged somehow fabulously — and much to the chagrin of the onlooking despot — with a 
                shocking eloquence for libertarianism. These ideas, developed throughout the enlightenment, 
                create a palpable and infectious love for life, a will to forge one’s destiny, a willingness 
                to accept both the glory and misery of risk-taking ventures, and an advocation of ideals rooted
                 in practical government that best resembles humanism, optimism, and self representation.
                 <br><br>
                
                Sadly, these convictions are once again being threatened by those whose hubris and arrogance 
                exceed their grasp. <br><br>
                
                The 21st century philosopher kings have ascended, mostly in academia, where they talk of a 
                “revolution”. Not the type of revolution that throws off the shackles of a violent despot, 
                but one that micro-manages our words, tells us what to eat, controls our travel, uses facial 
                recognition to monitor behavior, establishes a social credit score to coerce compliance, 
                propagates the airwaves with obsolete dogmas, and reduces our very existence to a horrific 
                collection of groups. Like Marx, the neo-Marxists envision a totalitarian state, predicated on 
                technocracy, the consolidation of power, and the destruction of the individual. 
                And similar to pseudo intellectuals of the dark ages, these academics are once again on
                 the march, threatening humanity with their watered down degrees, outworn slogans,
                 and charlatan ideals. <br> <br>
                
                Marx accurately predicted class warfare, the consolidation of industry, the degradation of 
                culture in the face of Dionysian indulgences, and the inequality that would emerge from 
                capitalism more broadly; but despite these negative externalities, and the historical 
                consequences of totalitarianism, Marx, like Rousseau, called for a "revolution" to implement a 
                half-baked conception that would rival Thomas More’s dystopian nightmare without once considering 
                individuals themselves. If history has taught us anything, it's that the wheels of democratic 
                legislation are always too slow for the power grabbing apparatchik. <br><br>
                
                Today, we must now recognize that Hobbes factions, and Marx’s class warfare find themselves at our 
                doorstep. For some, this moment signifies the end of an epoch, the death knell of capitalism, 
                democracy, individuality, private property, and universality more generally. 
                But the Rousseau’s of today propose no better alternative. 
                They call for a revolution with the same sort of arrogance, discarding previous failures as 
                “trial runs” or “managerial incompetence”. In their view, the state is supreme, the individual 
                is a nuisance, and if only the lower class plebes would listen to their high class "genius" we'd 
                all live in perfect order and harmony. Perhaps the greatest illustration of obnoxious hubris,
                not uncommon in academia, is Bentham's will. To this day, his head and body are still on display 
                in London, representing an egocentric genius who audaciously believed that his stuffed body 
                would "inspire" posterity. <br><br>
                
                Of course, these nominalist doomsayers and charlatan utopian peddlers never provide solutions, 
                coherent frameworks, or anything resembling originality. 
                The laity awaits for the utopia these philosopher kings so virtuously propagate, 
                in which they aimlessly engage in activism, fruitlessly borne out of some misconception of 
                self - some sort of cosmic heroic hubris and self righteous idealism predicated upon the profane. 
                Anarcho-syndicalism, a much better alternative to Marxism, is still much too abstract to be 
                considered viable. Not to mention, there is nothing in the capitalistic framework that prohibits 
                cooperatives from forming. In other words, one doesn't need a "revolution" to achieve Chomsky's 
                vision of a "better world". <br><br>
                
                The real problem is not capitalism as a mode of production, but economies of scale created by 
                special interests, tax loopholes, patents, and government subsidies. 
                One could argue that globalism, and the consolidation of industry more specifically, 
                is the primary impediment to a better life. Oligopolies, duopolies, and monopolies, 
                are not "fair" competition. Such consolidation and economies of scale force mom and pop 
                stores out of business, gut downtowns, dislocate populations, create barriers to entry, 
                erect malls upon malls of urban sprawl, corrupt our politics, and force more people to become 
                mere cogs in an anti-social machine - a machine with an endless hunger for efficiency over form, 
                for profit over beauty. <br><br>
                
                For Marx, and his modern day pupils, the answer to better government is to strip one’s 
                individuality. In that bleak world, humanity is reduced to Borg like creatures, 
                living meaningless communitarian style lives in which every form is identical, and 
                where every action is predetermined by “inclusive” masters. Collectivist mega corporations, 
                and academic echo chambers, are microcosms of this corrupted ecosystem. 
                To see the degradation of our individuality one only has to look at the lack of aesthetics 
                in modern day architecture — always built to maximize space — and compare them to the splendid 
                gothic cathedrals and other magnificent structures of self expression, culture, music and identity 
                so erected by the antecedent. These former structures were creative, passionate, romantic, 
                and have inspired generations to strive for the extraordinary - they embody the spirit of an 
                epoch, the zeitgeist of an avant-garde, and the momentous conception of glorious idealism. <br><br>
                
                To reclaim our destiny, we must once again embrace individuality, uphold universality, and 
                reject global financial interests and governments that subvert the individual in favor of 
                the collective. A coherent framework involves holding despots accountable, whether statesmen, 
                academics or boardrooms, who seek to destroy liberty, forms and culture for monied interests. <br><br><br>

                Sincerely, <br><br>
                Liam Danneskjold <br>
